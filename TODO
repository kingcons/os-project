**Brit's TODO
From highest priority to lowest...

1.
A current MOD bug seems to be caused by job 7. Job 7 unloads and sets its start-ram to -1 and then reloads somehow setting the breg to -1. Try to fetch on that and boom.
Job 3 executes but we round the eventual result rather than storing the float average. Is this correct?
Profiling still does nothing when enabled, finish it.
Test profiling.
Test kernel.
2.
Get multiple CPUs running and ensure that the concurrency issues are worked out with the ready-queue, memory, disk and pcb. Other places?
3.
Start on phase 2 (paging).

Long Term/Fun:
Just make the code ungross.
Work on style, eliminate hacks, improve readability+formatting, etc.
-- Abstract things where possible. Use macros (read macros) where necessary/sane.
--- Potential targets:
---- Cpu.lisp is easily the ugliest code in the whole project.
----- Decode in particular is 120 lines of raw madness. Refactor, rewrite, sanify.
