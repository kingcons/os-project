**Brit's TODO
From highest priority to lowest...

2.
Profiling still does nothing when enabled, finish it.
Test decode and fetch on job 1.
Test profiling.
Test scheduler changes.
Test kernel.

4. *Very Low Priority, Speculative*
Ensure correctness of MOV.

;; Watch lecture 01 again, ensure conformance to ideas about RQ/Scheduler + PCB?

Long Term/Fun:
Just make the code ungross.
Work on style, eliminate hacks, improve readability+formatting, etc.
-- Abstract things where possible. Use macros where necessary/sane.
--- Potential targets:
---- Abstract out differences between pretty-print-asm and decode.
------ The bulk of pretty-print-asm should be reduced to
-------- (decode opcode :raw t :ins-data t :op-data t) and format on that.
---- Cpu.lisp is easily the ugliest code in the whole project.
----- Decode in particular is 120 lines of raw madness. Refactor, rewrite, sanify.
---- Unify load-job and unload-job. That is totally one function waiting to happen.
